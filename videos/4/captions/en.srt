1
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:14,269
So we back in the mine

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,630
Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side

3
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,244
Side-side to side

4
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:22,236
This task, a grueling one

5
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:25,597
Hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night

6
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,211
Diamonds tonight

7
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:30,203
Heads up

8
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:33,937
You hear a sound, turn around and look up

9
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:36,178
Total shock fills your body

10
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,921
Oh no, it's you again

11
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,531
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes

12
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:43,149
Eyes-eyes-eyes

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,887
'Cause, baby, tonight

14
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:51,116
The creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again

15
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,854
'Cause, baby, tonight

16
00:00:53,855 --> 00:01:00,078
Grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,439
And run, run until it's done, done

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,049
Until the sun comes up in the morn'

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,788
'Cause, baby, tonight

20
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:16,261
The creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again (Stuff again-gain)
