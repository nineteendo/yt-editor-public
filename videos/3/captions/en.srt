00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,071
One, two, three!

2
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:32,071
There's a zombie on your lawn

3
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:37,214
There's a zombie on your lawn

4
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:41,214
There's a zombie on your lawn

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,071
We don't want zombies on the lawn

6
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:49,071
I know your type: tall, dark, and dead

7
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:52,071
You want to bite all the petals off of my head

8
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:56,071
And then eat the brains of the one who planted me here. No!

9
00:00:56,358 --> 00:01:00,642
I'm just a sunflower, but see me power an entire infantry

10
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,642
You like the taste of brains, we don't like zombies
