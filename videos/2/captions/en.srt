00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:33,347


2
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:40,086
Ever on and on I continue circling with nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

3
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:47,043
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing and suddenly I see that I can't break free

4
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity with nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

5
00:00:54,001 --> 00:01:00,956
To tell me who I am, who I was, uncertainty enveloping my mind till I can't break free

6
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:04,000
And maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

7
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,043
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

8
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:14,000
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside and I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night
